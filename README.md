# VRAPTesting

A testing simulation written in Unity for use with the Oculus Rift and Touch

## Overview

This project was an assignment for my high school Calculus class. The purpose was to provide the most accurate simualtion of an Advanced Placement test possible, through the use of current Virtual Reality technology. The assignment itself was a pretty vague one about helping kids study for the test, and most people did something simple like a quiz or a board game, but I decided to have some fun with it.

The experience is rather simple. You are put in a room with a table, a desk and pencil. You must fill in your answer on the paper with your pencil, and then submit your answer with a button. There is then feedback on if you got the question correct or not.

The project features sample questions for tests on Caluclus, Psychology and Biology. You can easily choose your test through the interactive game menuing.

The main point of this project is obviously the Virtual Reality integration: you will need an Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch controllers in order to play. It should work natively with the Oculus SDK - make sure you allow outside applications.

## Creation

This project was created using the Unity 3D engine alongside the tools provided by Oculus to work with their headset. All of the script files were written in C#, using the  Microsoft Visual Studio that is standard to use with Unity development. It has only been run on Windows machines, I believe specifically only Windows 10 machines.
